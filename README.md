🧮 Health Calculator (BMI + Calories + Goals)

This Python program allows users to calculate important health metrics based on their personal information. It asks the user for their age, gender, weight, height, and activity level, then calculates:

✔ BMI (Body Mass Index)

Shows the exact BMI value

Displays the BMI category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)

✔ Daily Calories Burned

Uses the Harris-Benedict BMR formula and activity level to estimate how many calories the user burns each day.

✔ Goal-Based Calorie Recommendation

The user chooses whether they want to gain or lose weight, and the program recommends how many calories they should eat per day.
